# Algorithm Studies

This repository documents my journey in learning algorithms and data structures.

## Current Study Resource

I am currently learning from [Frontend Masters' Algorithms Course by ThePrimeagen](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).  
ThePrimeagen is an excellent teacher with deep knowledge and great didactic skills.

## Learning in Practice

The concepts I learn from the course are being put into practice through solving LeetCode problems. This problems are reinforcing my understanding of algorithms and improving my problem-solving skills.

## Future Plans

- **Complete the Course**: I will finish this course and ensure I grasp all its key concepts.
- **Continue Learning**: This is just the beginning! I plan to explore more advanced algorithm topics and resources in the future.
- **Enhance This Repository**: Over time, I will structure and expand this `README.md` file.
